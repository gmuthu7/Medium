Regression, the Gaussian Process way
Gaussian process regression is a non-linear regression model. Gaussian process models are used extensively in areas like hyperparameter tuning and image processing. Much like the well-known linear regression or neural network models, it is at its core, a function approximator which fits a function to a set of points. 
But, unlike linear regression or neural networks, it is a non-parametric model, which means that there are no explicit parameters like weights or coefficients and it derives its predictions directly from the entire training dataset. It is also a Bayesian model, which means you can impart prior knowledge directly into the model to improve its performance and more importantly, you can get an estimate of uncertainity of your predictions.
