Are we just unique functions?
Sounds like a weird question doesn't it? With recent advancements in machine learning and especially, Reinforcement Learning (RL), we are getting closer and closer towards AGI.
If Neil Armstrong took one giant step for mankind on the moon, ChatGPT did the same for AI on earth. ChatGPT is, at its core, a parameterised function approximator and the parameters are the weights of the neural network. It is trained on pretty much everything that's available on the internet but the end result is a function with a unique set of weights.
Psychology has some answers regarding how human beings make decisions and the debate is whether humans learn by trial-and-error or by deliberative planning when they are in a situation. In the former, we take an action, observe some response from the environment and based on whether the response is "good" or "bad", we decide whether to take the same action again when we encounter a similar situation in the future. In the latter, we have some assumptions about what response we might get from the environment, and based on these assumptions, we make our decision. If our assumptions are incorrect, we correct our assumptions so that the next time we are in a similar situation, we make a more informed decision.
