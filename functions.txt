Are we just unique functions?
Sounds like a weird question doesn't it? With recent advancements in machine learning and especially, Reinforcement Learning (RL), we are getting closer and closer towards AGI.
If Neil Armstrong took one giant step for mankind on the moon, ChatGPT did the same for AI on earth. ChatGPT is, at its core, a parameterised function approximator and the parameters are the weights of the neural network. It is trained on pretty much everything that's available on the internet but the end result is a function with a unique set of weights.
